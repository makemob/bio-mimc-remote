# bio-mimic-remote
Android/iOS remote control application for bio-mimic.


There are 2 Unity projects:
- uki-remote - the remote control app for mobile devices
- uki-server-example - reference code for the server side

Both projects need Unity 5.4.2p3 or later for critical bug fixes to Unity networking.

The current Android build can be found at \uki-remote\Builds\uki-remote.apk

Demo:
- run the uki-server-example project in the Unity editor
- install .apk to Android device and run
- on the Android app set the server IP address to establish a connection
